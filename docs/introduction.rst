wharfrat is intended to make it easy and convenient to use a development
environment in a docker container. The benefits of this are:

 * **Simple:** A new development environment is setup with a single simple
   command, meaning new team members are ready to go immediately.

 * **Shared:** Everyone with access to the project (and docker) has access to
   the development environment.

 * **Controlled:** Everyone gets a development environment created from the same
   image - no more "works for me" issues.

 * **Versioned:** The configuration is version controlled, meaning you get the
   development environment that matches the code branch you are working on.
